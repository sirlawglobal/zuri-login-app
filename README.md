How it can be tested locally:

1. Start by cloning the repository, that would download a zip file to your local system.

2. Unzip file to get the folder.

3. move the folder to xampp folder, and paste in the htdocs folder. 
If you are using Wamp you move it to the wamp folder, and paste in the www folder.

4. Start up Xampp or Wamp and the call the localhost/"name of the file" then you begin exploring the system.

Note: for my program I created an access for superadmin locally: to login as admin use
email: admin@gmail.com
Password: admin
